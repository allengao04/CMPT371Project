## Project Overview
A multiplayer Quiz Game built with PyGame for graphics and TCP sockets for networking. One player’s machine acts as the server (host), and others connect as clients using direct socket connections. Players compete in a large 2D grid world to collect “microphone” items. Picking up a microphone triggers a quiz question for that player. Correct answers earn points.
